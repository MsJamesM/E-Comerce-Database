# E-Comerce-Database

## Description

"Internet retail, also known as **e-commerce**, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019." This project was built using starter code provided by Denver University's Coding Boot Camp as part of a challenge assignment. The challenge was to build the back end for an e-commerce site by configuring a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Installation

To use this application, install a functioning 'M' key for your keyboard if you haven't already. Now proceed to installing the necessary software. If you don't already have a source-code editor, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), you will need to install one. You will also need to install a version control system, such as [Git](https://git-scm.com), along with your server environment, such as [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). Please also install [MySql](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql), a relational database management system for accessing and modifying data in this project. Finally, you will need an API development platform, such as [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest). Installation for this software is provided in each link. Please follow provided instructions for individual installation.

You may now proceed with copying or [cloning](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repository to your machine.

## Usage

Given the project files have been copied to your machine, navigate to the project's root E-Commerce-Database folder. Using Git, or a compatible source-code editor, open your terminal and type the command:

`npm i`

Navigate to the project's _Develop_ folder, then to its _db_ folder. Open the project's _schema.sql_ file using your source-code editor, copy the code, and paste it into MySQL. Back in Git, run the command:

`npm run seed`

To start your server, run the following command:

`node server.js`

Make sure your .env file is properly configured. [What is an .env file?](https://thenewstack.io/what-is-the-docker-env-file-and-how-do-you-use-it/)

Next, open Insomnia. To modify the database using Insomnia, please refer to the following visuals. [(Full video)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tw-aQ1VIMOytL6Q-oUuYfMwolYsNREE_/view?usp=drive_link)
